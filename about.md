Welcome to my blog Sajeta. The name comes from the word Å ajeta. It means lightning in my local istrian dialect.
I intend to use this site to post various technical writeups of projects I did / am doing, but I will also maaaybe post some other stuff, we will see what the time brings :). 

If you wish to contact me, please visit my personal website: [lukalevac.com](https://www.lukalevac.com/#contact)

This blog borrows the Jekyll theme from [pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) made by John Otander.
